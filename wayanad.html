                        Flowing over three tiers of rocky hills, the Meenmutty Falls begin from a height of over 800 feet. The first tier can be reached conveniently after walking for about half a kilometre. The second one needs to be trekked to, and even if you aren’t a fan of treks, the picturesque views around make the journey worth it.

Once at the top, the views of surrounding valleys is absolutely astounding. The mesmerising sight of the Banasura Sagar Dam and the falls in their full glory is what makes this tourist spot a favourite among the waterfalls near Mysore.
