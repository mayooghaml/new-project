                    <p>
                        Located at a distance of few kms from Erattupetta in Kottayam inside a private rubber estate, Marmala Waterfalls are popularly known as the ‘enchantress of the jungle’. Plummeting from a height of 200 feet, the unblemished clear waters create an aura of mist around them. The tantalising waterfalls splash into a 12 feet pond and run down to join the river Teekoy. Replete with timber trees on the green-carpeted mountains, the clear cascading waters offer a sight like no other.

                        Blessed with a rich biodiversity, an emerald forest cover and an all around utopian environment, the waterfalls is the perfect place to get away from the din and chaos of the city and spend some moments of solitude to reinvigorate and rejuvenate.</p></div>

                      <h5 class="d-name">Vaikom</h5>
                      <p>Vaikom is a town located in the district of Kottayam in Kerala. It was also a destination of Satyagraha during the Indian Independence Movement. It is the oldest city in Kottayam and lies very close to the famous tourist spot of Kumarakom. Vaikom Temple lies at the heart of the town and becomes very prominent during its Vaikom Ashtami celebrations during the month of November. This temple was constructed in the year 1594. It is also enclosed by a courtyard which is spread across 8 acres of land.

                      The history of Vaikom can be traced back to the time when there existed a kingdom known as Venmalanadu of which Vaikom is a part. Later, Venmalanadu was broken down into Vadakkumkoor and Thekkumkoor.</p></div>

                      <p>
                        Located at a distance of 15 kms from Thodupuzha and 60 kms from Kottayam, Elaveezha Poonchira is a small quaint hill station. Perched at a height of 3200 feet above the sea level, it can be reached by a jeep ride through the unpaved rocky mountainous terrain. Literally translating to a ‘flowery lake where no leaves fall’, the place has acres of barren land without any plantation or trees with a perennial lake ‘Poonchira’. The area receives heavy rainfall, and the entire valley turns into a river during monsoons.

                        A well kept secret of Kerala, Elaveezha Poonchira is replete with rocky cliffs, contours and crevices and hence, lures a lot of trekkers, mountaineers and adventure enthusiasts to the spot to try their hand at trekking.</p></div>

                          <p>
                            Located around 50 kms from the town of Kottayam near Ernakulam, Chottanikkara is the most revered of the 393 Hindu shrines spread across 3 districts in the state of Kerala. Popular for its spectacular architecture, the shrine stands out to be the ultimate testimonial for the primordial vishwakarma sthapathis (wooden sculpture) in carving out this temple. Sree Mahamaya Bhagawati (Aadiparashakthi), believed to be the supreme mother Goddess in Hindu religion, also known as the Goddess of Power presides the temple. Popularly known as Chottanikkara Devi, the Goddess is worshipped in three forms at three different times of the day. In the morning, she is worshipped as Maha Saraswati (Mother of Knowledge), decked in white; in the afternoon, she is worshipped as Maha Lakshmi (Mother of Wealth), clad in crimson; and in the evening, she is worshipped as Sree Durga (Mother of Power), draped in blue.</p></div>

                            Popular for its cascading waterfalls, blue mountains, meandering rivers, clear waters and misty environment, Vagamon is a quaint little hilltown bordering the districts of Kottayam and Idukki. Three mighty hills known as Thangal, Murugan and Kurisumala form the essence of the town. Colloquially known as Thangal Para, Thangal Hills are an important pilgrimage spot of the Muslims, located barely 5 kms from Vagamon. The whopping boulder at the top of the hill houses the mausoleum of Sheikh Fariduddin (mazaar/ dargaah of Sheikh Fariduddin) and is visited by thousands of Muslim pilgrims annually during the festival of Urs. Just below the rock boulder at the bottom of the hill, is a mosque used by the devotees and the locals to offer their prayers.

Surrounded by emerald green meadows and verdant tea- plantations, the hilltop also provides some awe-striking panoramic vistas of the valley below lined with trees of pepper, vanilla, rubber and coffee.</p></div>

                            <p>A significant center of Syrian Christians of Kerala, St. Mary's Orthodox Church was originally a Malankara Orthodox Church. Located about 4 km from the Kottayam in Cheriyapalli, the structure was established by king of Tekkemur in 1579.

                                The church is built in Portuguese style of architecture; however one can clearly see the influence of traditional Hindu architectural style. The walls of the buildings are ornamented with fascinating stone carvings and murals depicting biblical and non-biblical themes</p></div>
